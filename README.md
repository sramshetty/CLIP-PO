# CLIP-RL
Tuning CLIP with RL

Goals:
- [ ] Collect ranking dataset
    - [ ] Source textual prompts for image retrieval (use the captions themselves?)
    - [ ] Source visual prompts for textual retrieval (use the captions themselves?)
        - If locked encoder tuning can apply to either encoder
    - [ ] Retrieve 4-9 images for each prompt
- [ ] Collect/Create rankings
- [ ] Train reward model
- [ ] Finetune CLIP variants and benchmark
